# Why degoogle your life?

Tech is supposed to be a helpful tool, also allowing us to consume content, but always as a means to

Information to degoogle and have more control over your tech.

## 1. Browser and Search Engine

Brave and duckduckgo.

## 2. Email, Calendar and Cloud Storage.

Proton.

For projects, opensource, like github.

## 3. Content

You can get content from youtube channels, and even news articles, by using their RSS feeds.

For instance, on youtube, have account turned off. The script in this repository can be used for this.

For other news/content, the same can be made.

With time, you'll see u dont care about some of the channels. This is not to pass the idea of "phone bad", but "being overwhelmed and with no autonomy is bad". Content is great, but you need to be able to clearly choose what you want to see. And after a quarter of a life consuming a lot of content, maybe clearly controling it is the best. Again, technology is supposed to help you out, not consider your life and attention as a market niche to be explored.
